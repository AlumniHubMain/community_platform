I worked with him for several years both as with my direct subordinate and as with my colleague when he became Skyeng’s CPO, and it was always a pleasure to have him around and be able to count on him at challenging times. \n\nDenis started as Product Marketing Manager and became Head of Product of the Commercial Department in no time, gaining responsibility for the whole customer journey till the 1st paid lesson, being also in charge of commercial analytics, marketing tests, and sales process automation. Thanks to his efforts, we re-launched all the marketing products, significantly increased conversion rates, built complicated analytical infrastructure, and improved the visual representation of the brand.\n\nDenis always hired great employees, brilliant and motivated, yet affordable for each given stage of the company's evolution. What is even more important, he created outstanding product culture in his teams, allowing his teammates to grow fast and become deeply professional. \n\nDenis is a rare example of a manager that is totally result-oriented, yet enormously empathic, winning people over and making everyone come to him for advice, mentorship, or just consolation. I believe he had a very strong impact on the company's culture, making it so friendly and so demanding at the same time.\n\nI am sure that Denis' profound expertise and vision, his ability to switch from a helicopter view to hands-on tasks, together with his talent for people make him an outstanding specialist for any ambitious business.",

          "description": "I worked with Denis on a new product launch and highly recommend him as a seasoned CPO. \n\nThe goal was to find a market and a target segment for the product that had previously only been used internally by the company's teams. Also to determine how much time and funding it would take to launch its MVP and what are the possible risks. Having made this assessment, Denis realised that the risks and the amount of investment required were too significant. Therefore, the project was closed, and the team focused on more promising areas. \n\nIt might not sound like a success story, however, I see Denis's merit in making decisions based on data and saving the company from possible (huge) losses. \n\nDenis set specific goals for the team, making it transparent to everyone what results are expected and what tasks are the most essential. The team worked in week-long agile sprints, maintaining focus and moving quickly toward a solution. \n\nDenis not only managed the process, but also did many of the tasks himself, drawing on expertise from various professional areas. For example, he created a landing page, launched an advertising campaign, and set up a sales funnel. He calculated the economics of the product and determined how long it would take us to cover our operating expenses. \n\nAlthough the work was challenging, I felt comfortable working with Denis. It was a time of drive and fun thanks to the way he communicates and leads the team. Denis gave a lot of freedom to determine which methods you want to use to accomplish a task, and didn’t compromise your ability to handle it. He was ready to support, discuss difficulties that arise and come up with a solution together. I would say that his leadership style was based on empathy and equality, which I appreciate at work.",

Examples being a unified customer feature collection, the app we've developed internally for advanced experiment design and analysis, and his work on targeted advertising using causal inference methods.\nAt the same time, Alexander is a pleasure to collaborate with - it's only thanks to such a collaboration that the CausalTune library is as powerful and usable as it is; and as part of his customer understanding and experimentation work he's developed and maintained great working relationships with many colleagues from both Marketing and Product. \nOverall, the combination of a truly impressive technical ability with an easygoing and helpful personality makes Alexander a colleague to treasure.",

This initiative plays an important role in understanding customer feedback, interactions, and requests, which are fundamental for Wise’s mission.\n\nAlexander consistently showed great professionalism, with a strong talent for organizing product development and focusing on the most important elements. His ability to foresee potential challenges and find effective solutions was key to the project's success.\n\nAdditionally, Alexander played a central role in creating an internal A/B testing analytics platform. This platform was successfully launched and has greatly improved the standardisation of feature testing processes and the analysis of user behaviour within the company.\n\nI highly recommend Alexander as a talented and dedicated professional who makes a tangible impact on any project he’s involved in.",

Moreover, many wallets have their own validators set by default (Phantom, Cosmostation) what leads to conflict of interest.\n\nWe fix this by unifying the staking experience on the frontend level by integrating wallets and native staking in top PoS chains. Our partner validators get their own \"shopify page\". Take a glimpse:\nhttps://app.hodla.org/allnodes\n\nWhere we are now:\n- Live on 16 chains, 7 validators onboard including top-5 validator Allnodes ($2.7B staked)\n- 4x hack winner from Interchain Foundation, Akash, Archway & Comdex\n- Negotiations with 50 more validators\n- Currently participating in the NEAR Horizon Accelerator",

    "summary": "Starting as a Java Software Engineer in June 2021, I played an instrumental role in refactoring Yandex.Market's backoffice services, aiding the project's transition from Oracle to PostgreSQL DBMS. My responsibilities further expanded from September 2021 to September 2022 in Moscow, where I was integral in developing backend systems for Yandex.Market's transportation logistics. I also notably contributed to the creation of a Warehouse Management System. Addressing emergency system issues, I provided pivotal support as an on-call engineer. Ascending to the role of Java Software Engineer & Technical Lead in October 2022, I undertook the management of several large-scale projects. These ranged from key integrations related to transportation logistics to pioneering process automations. Beyond project management, I led cross-functional teams, optimised communications, introduced innovative project tracking methodologies, participated actively in hiring, and delivered enlightening talks on software engineering productivity.\n\nDuring my tenure at the Higher School of Economics, I served as a Machine Learning Teaching Assistant from July to December 2020 in Moscow. Here, I was responsible for grading machine learning assignments crafted in Python, conducting insightful oral exams, and imparting guidance on a plethora of data science tools and foundational concepts. Furthermore, from November to December 2019, I also contributed as a Teaching Assistant for the Introduction to Data Science course, specifically designed for non-tech students. My role was pivotal in assessing students' work on elementary machine learning concepts executed within spreadsheets. Additionally, I was entrusted with the duty of providing students with a robust grounding in data science essentials, with a keen emphasis on the practical application of MS Excel for data analysis. My academic journey culminated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the Higher School of Economics in 2022.",

During this period Cathie proved that she can deal with any type of task, including: \na) building a transparent system of inter-team cooperation for the whole commercial department (50+ people), which consists of task-tracking rules and a certain level of automation.\nb) forming from scratch a complex monitoring system that is set to automatically identify infrastructure problems at the very beginning and then urgently inform the process owners to minimize possible idle time and money loss.\nc) setting up the telemarketing teams across the globe, including Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Israel, Dubai, Turkey, and many more to come... Cathie was responsible for sales strategy implementation, hiring staff, setting up KPIs, and automation of analytics tracking based on the raw primary data.\n\nCathie showed outstanding skills in self-organization and was always eager to learn something new. I also want to state her remarkable communication skills and polished English language proficiency. Being a committed team player, she remained optimistic even under the toughest deadlines – it helped a lot to build a unique working atmosphere within the team.",

I have a strong background in product, project, team and people management. My goal is to create products that help users meet their needs. I'm an advocate for  Data-Driven and Lean approaches.\n\nI started my professional career as an engineer at the Service Desk. That experience helped me understand users' needs. Due to my active processes optimization, I managed to achieve the leading position of the Moscow Technical Support Group in just six months. While serving as team leader, in addition to my mandatory responsibilities (such as optimizing processes and managing the team), I launched a support channel via a Telegram bot, a system for processing and resolving users’ requests, a system for profiling new employees and a support web portal.These projects initiated the “Helpy” support ecosystem which won the \"Project of the Year\" award from the Global CIO in 2023.\n\nIn spring 2020 I joined the Internal IT Solutions Development Department, where I successfully integrated a secure printing system, and linked back office work processes (legal documents’ drafting, office support operations, etc) into Microsoft 365. I also designed an OKR-based goal-setting process that improved efficiency and effectiveness for both the Service Desk and my departments.\n\nFor the past two years I’ve been working as a product manager at Yandex Drive, a carsharing company. During this period of time I’ve conducted 20+ experiments, resulting in a decrease in median registration time to 15 minutes, a rise in registration rate of more than 10% and CR from registration to first trip more than 20% as well as a 15% increase in profit from new users. \n\nCurrently I’ve been actively updating our application in Yandex Go super-app , aiming to improve user experience, expand the service capabilities and attract new customers.\n\nMy superpower is team building as well as identifying and fixing bottlenecks. I am always eager to learn new skills, explore challenges and connect with like-minded professionals.\n\nJoin LinkedIn to share an experience.",

During this time, he set up a lot of complex processes, designing them and implementing then.\n\nFedor assembled a touch map from scratch, decomposing the client's path into components, identifying the bottlenecks. In particular, the entire registration path was marked up, decomposed into data, and for each of the stages a set of touches were prepared to move client further down the funnel. Fedor used existing touch methods (email communications, phone calls), and also used new ones (robotic calls and communications in a mobile application). It is also important to note that a number of tools were invented by him - together with the product and developers team, according to the design and logic described by Fedor. This tool made it possible to flexibly customize communication messages to customers depending on their geography, industry, and life cycle stage. Together with the marketing and design team, Fedor worked on the communication wording, on the visual component.\n\nAs part of the work on customer touch, Fedor managed a team of 60 people. For the most important communications, such as customer launches and churn prevention, live calls were used. Fedor built a system for daily monitoring of team activity and performance, as well as the impact of each employee on business metrics. He has shown excellent organizational skills by educating, motivating and involving the team.\n\nIn tight cooperation with the product team, Fedor took part in the development of a commercial product for the SMB segment, participating in regular task prioritization, testing the viability of product hypotheses and organizing field research and cusdevs.\n\nFedor also independently prepared dashboards of employee activity, analytics of their effectiveness within a week and a month, and indicators of the impact on the company's business. Each touch was tied to an analytics of the client's behavior after, in comparison with the control group. As part of this work, Fedor showed his skills in working with data (SQL).\n\nThus, for all the time we worked together, Fedor proved to be an excellent and reliable, stress-resistant project manager, with excellent analytical skills. Regarding the soft skills - Fedor is very open, sociable and brought a lot to the spirit of our team.",

Меня зовут Влад.\n\nРешение о выборе сферы, в которой тебе нравится работать было принять не легко, но взвесив все плюсы(коммуникабельность, активность) и минусы(нон-стоп работать) направления, было принято решение выбрать именно его, так как и плюсы, и минусы описывают настоящего меня, такого, какой я есть. Я занимаюсь проджект-менеджментом уже около 8 месяцев. С моим участием был запущен хакатон в Яндексе, организованный совместно с учебником и Алисой, в котором было 80.000 участников. Я коммуникабельный, ответственный, умею убеждать и договариваться.\nГотов рассмотреть любой формат работы, предпочтительнее всего будет гибридный.",

Alexander was in charge of developing methodology of the study, procurement issues, choosing the supplier that matches Rostelecom scale of business, and delivering the results to our marketing and product teams. He helped to shepherd the task force of 12 researchers at Ipsos agency and run the workshop that turned our findings into actionable insights and strategy.

His exceptional project management and leadership skills with his willingness to take on new challenges significantly contributed in operational and growth metrics.\n\nI consider Anton to be a professional of extraordinary abilities and someone I could always rely on.

This is why I decided to extend an offer and invite him to join my team.\n\nDuring our time together at the Yandex Search team, we faced numerous challenges. Alexander consistently demonstrated not only a commitment to continuous growth but also a keen interest in addressing business problems.\n\nWhen I decided to transition to the Yandex Services team, I knew that having Alexander join me would be the best outcome for the entire design function. At Yandex Services, Alexander took on the full responsibility for the Suppliers aspect of the product and managed it superbly. Additionally, he participated in the development of a new design system, which accelerated the progress of the entire team. Alexander also led multiple research initiatives and provided support to the team during the challenging times of pivoting our business model.\n\nWorking together has been a pleasure, and I sincerely hope we have the opportunity to collaborate once again in the future!",

I still submit my libraries to Quicklisp, but personally I entirely switched from the Quicklisp dist to the Ultralisp dist.\n\nAlexander's Common Lisp Project of the Day initiative is an interesting step towards fixing our Discoverability Problem, already featuring more than 200 projects!

She is able to manage any complex technical project since I'm sure she'd find an appropriate solution even if things wouldn't work out for the first time and she'd manage to deliver it in time. Alexandra is really detail oriented and I appreciate her ability to accept new challenges. She had successfully launched quite complicated products based on machine learning and she was able to learn how it works. She can speak both in terms of metrics and in terms of business, and she finds a good way how to be both tough and thoughtful with her team, and build the trust the team needs.\nI wish Alexandra all the best and I am pretty sure she is well prepared to new career challenges!",

Over the last four years, I've launched two brands, one capturing 68% market share in a competitive niche, outperforming strong competitors, and executed numerous 360-degree and tactical data-driven campaigns with notable business impact.\n\nI blend the test-and-learn approach of product marketing with strategic methods of classical brand management. I can provide value if your challenges are:\n\n1. Launch new products or business verticals by driving cross-functional efforts, ensuring team alignment, conducting research for market insights, developing product and brand positioning, and executing go-to-market strategies of any scale – from owned to ATL channels.\n\n2. Accelerate growth and reduce user acquisition costs by optimizing customer experience and introducing brand marketing to the performance & owned media mix. I can develop an overarching communications strategy that balances paid, owned, and earned traffic while collaborating with media, creative, PR, social, influencer, and performance marketing teams.\n\n3. Build strong relationships across business, analytic, tech and creative departments, converting potential conflicts into fruitful collaboration.\n\nI will be relocating to Portugal with a valid work visa in August. I am eager to join a tech company or corporation business unit in scaling or accelerated growth stages. I seek a team where I can own a distinct marketing stream — from market definition and product influence to user acquisition and brand building — and grow as a leader. However, I am open to discussing your ambition, my role, and my field of influence.\n\nI am also available to offer expert advice as a contract contributor.

Also, it's really pleasant to improve some old stuff to make it work faster. Nevertheless, I try not to overengineer things, because time is as important as code quality itself.\n \nAs for my hobbies, I like to annoy my cat by trying to pet him 24/7. I'm really keen on nature and traveling. Camping is the best thing in the world. Also, I don't mind spending my time gaming, and just like all of us, I'm trying to start doing sports every single Monday.",

I was always amazed at how accurately she can remember all the details of all processes and how she keeps everything under control. At the same time, it was a pleasure to work with her, as it was her who created the feeling of a team and took care of everyone.

He was not only genuinely committed to my success, but to the success of the entire design team and company. Besides building a great design culture and team he also made sure designers always had a seat at the table when important decisions were being made.\n\nI’m thankful I got the opportunity to work with Kostya, and am envious of those who get to work with him in the future.",

She worked on my team at Yandex for only about 9 months, but had made a noticeable impact in our projects and goals improving quality of Yandex Web search engine. At that time she solved various problems related to machine learning (specifically, YATI - our new transformer model trained to predict Web page relevance) and demonstrated her ability to handle complex experimental research tasks with only limited supervision. In addition to engineering aptitude Daria has good communication skills and after joining quickly became a valued member of our team with her own area of expertise.

She developed a method to use robotic computer vision to locate and pick up objects, such as a disk drive on a table.  She worked with our QA test team to use the robot to test a storage product.  Daria developed and taught a robotics training course to train engineers on how use and how drive our robot via Python.\n\nDaria Soboleva is one of those people who knows how to think: how to figure things out.  Presented with a problem, Daria is able to figure out how to solve it.  It is my pleasure to highly recommend Daria!",

Under his leadership, our team launched two apps: AiPal: Roleplay AI Story app that reached 200K+ downloads and started to bring revenue without additional marketing costs, and ChaChat: Friends, Chat & AI. Ivan was responsible for implementing and testing new features and coordinating the team in achieving KPIs. Ivan’a important quality is both openness to other team members’ ideas but also the ability to check their relevance before taking them into development.

During my project for Visa he was my direct manager and partner and together we pushed and worked on projects which were revolutionary in certain manners, which is not easy in a large organization. In anything Ken does he creates a steady knowledge background and can answer all upcoming questions which reduces the risk and insecurity for any stakeholder involved.  Ken is a good communicator and manages to establish mutually benefiting and stable realtionships with clients as well as suppliers. His knowledge of the Russian \"nature\" is far beyound the time he has spent in the country and is due to his good feeling for people, culture and personalities. \r\nWith Ken in a team any project and/or new venture will have a solid managerial and hands on foundation.",

Most importantly though, Artem is deeply passionate and very sincere. If he joins your cause he will really join.\r\n\r\nMy 3 favorite things about Artem; He engages in a cause totally, he wears his heart on his sleeve, and, he’s not afraid to take a risk.\r\n\r\n3 fine qualities indeed.",

This type of managers achieve the best results as they can build (not just drive) great developer, tester, writer, etc. Artem uses this great skill of giving pieces of wise advice but leaving the final decision the the performer - this way he ensures that the project he leads is under some reasonable level of control while everyone learns on his/her mistakes.\r\n\r\nI wish I would work with Artem sometime in the future on the \"real\" software project - it, for sure, would be a challenging and exciting experience and I know I would learn how to be a great leader/manager from him.",

Alex's initial assignment was to  maintain, refactor and add Unit Tests to some legacy Python code. He set off at an incredible pace and was very self sufficient throughout the exercise.  After a short period the code was analysed and documented to a high standard.   Thereafter he worked closely with his team mates to make some very worthwhile improvements to code readability, reliability and performance.  The latter by a factor of two.\nBut Alex was much more than a maintenance programmer; he demonstrated that he is very quick to learn new technologies, the highlight being some Natural Language Processing & Machine Learning features built from low level Python libraries.\nAlex is quiet and thoughtful to work with, but doesn't hesitate to contribute when he has input, which is always pertinent and well thought through.\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend Alex for future Senior Development / Architecture roles.",

          "description": "Hi, guys!\n\nI worked with Valeriy in the Yandex.Taxi project during the most turbulent periods of the company's growth, the development team grew 6-8 times in 1.5 years. This explosive growth is accompanied by a lot of chaos in management and software development. Working in such conditions is more difficult and stressful. During our work with Valeriy, I noticed that despite the external chaos, he always maintains clarity of mind and does his work on time and with high quality. When managers offered to do faster, but some shitcode, Valeriy always found arguments to write the code well. Valeriy also always helped colleagues and used his communication skills well. Based on this, I can conclude that Valeriy's coaching skills and leadership competencies are developed at a high level. His engineering skills are also very strong. Besides that he is a good guy=) I'm glad I worked with him.",

          "description": "TLDR: brilliant engineer with the skills to lead a team.\n\nI met Valeriy in 2015 while working at Rambler&Co, he was a Senior Software Engineer and I was managing the Development Team. I was impressed with Valeriy’s hard and soft skills and the sense of ownership. Later, I asked Valeriy to join the team at Domclick, he agreed and it was a complete success.\n\nValeriy is one of the best engineers I met in my career. No problem is too hard for him. As he joined a team at Domclick, he made an impact from day one, contributing to the most complex and challenging parts of the legacy system. Valeriy always demonstrated a high degree of ownership and never said “not my problem.” Therefore, shortly after joining our team at Domclick, he was leading a Search team, and he did great in this position, owning business-critical services and achieving very challenging and time-bound objectives. Valeriy’s engagement doesn’t end here: he led different cross-domain initiatives, such as Internship Program and Community Relationship, and was a mentor for many new-comers at Domclick. Moreover, Valeriy always strived for innovation and improvement of the processes: he led the creation of Config service and the process of System Design creation and review.\n\nIn my career, I wore many hats: starting as a developer, being a Head of group/department/domain, and reaching C-level, and I know the importance of well-paced, autonomous, experienced, dependable, and hardworking individuals. Valeriy is one of them, and I can recommend him without any reservation to any company or a team. I am absolutely positive Valeriy will succeed in any position: be it Individual Contributor or Leadership. \n\nPlease feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions, or to discuss the given letter in more detail.\n\nSimon Bagreev\nEngineering Manager, Medely\nPhone: +1(469) 666-0022\nsbagreev@gmail.com",

    "location": "Belgrade, Serbia",
    "summary": "I have been processing data for many years. At the beginning it was sociology and marketing research data. I applied different methods of data analysis. I also developed databases and software necessary to automate data processing.\nIn 2012 I started to work in Yandex in advertising technologies. I developed behavioral segments for media advertising and digital marketing. I combined the roles of an analyst and a product manager. After, for some time I promoted high-tech advertising products and custom solutions built using machine learning. But working in the commercial department turned out to be not as interesting to me as working in the development department. But I am glad that I got a new experience not only in product management, but in sales management as well.\nIn 2013, I changed my job in order to be engaged in the development of technological advertising products again. I moved to the Mail.ru Group company, where I created a new data analytics department. In 2015, we began to create a new line of business based on the usage of data and artificial intelligence technologies. Then my experience in the commercial department helped me. I was engaged in client service to help customers to find the best usage of our technology. The next new line of business in my department was a research project. We developed application in social networks VK and Odnoklassniki for conducting online surveys. My experience in marketing research helped me with this. It was completely my idea. This project gave us not only the opportunity to conduct sociological and marketing research, but also to obtain a lot of new data for building machine learning models. For example, psychological segmentation of social network users has become very popular in advertising technologies, marketing and product analytics.\nIn 2020, I changed my job and headed the AdTech direction at Rambler Group, the largest online media. I got a CTO position. I led the full-stack development of high load advertising technologies and Big Data technologies, including the development of a media content recommendation system.\nI am interested in everything related to user behavior. For example: developing predictive models based on their behavior, analyzing customer experience and improving it by implementing machine learning algorithms into the product. Despite the fact that I have been in management positions for a long time, I always had projects which I performed by myself as a programmer and data analyst. I am sure that I can start my career again and achieve success.",

Воспринимает проблемы качества работы алгоритмов машинного обучения очень ответственно и всегда доходит до сути проблемы. Настоятельно рекомендую Михаила всем, кто понимает, что за машинным обучением и аналитикой на самом деле стоит прибыль и качество. Он всегда настаивает на самых высоких стандартах работы, является надежным командным игроком и экспертом в предметной области.\nМихаил — один из тех выдающихся лидеров, которые фокусируются на потребностях клиентов и добиваются успеха во всех проектах, которыми он занимается. Он особенно хорошо понимает бизнес-перспективы новых уникальных аналитических продуктов для обработки данных. Его прямолинейный стиль, новаторский подход к решению проблем клиентов и сильная способность направлять клиентов к лучшим решениям для их бизнеса делают его важным активом для любой организации.

Эти качества отлично дополняют его исполнительность и умение работать в команде, а также умение руководить.

В частности, были реализованы проекты по интеграции системы комментирования LiveJournal в проект Videomore, а также систем постинга и share-платформы; были реализованы ряд контентных проектов; отдельно благодаря Антону было налажено плодотворное сотрудничество подконтрольных департаментов маркетинга LiveJournal Russia и СТС Media.\r\n\r\nЯ очень рекомендую Антона как отличного специалиста в области маркетинга.

As a product manager I worked closely with the designers and saw that they lacked immersion in solving business problems and working systematically on products. \n\nIn just a few months Kirill restructured the organizational framework, introduced a clear grading system and brought the team to an incredible pace of growth. As a result, we could feel that the design team became involved in the product and business processes, which had a positive impact on the results of all product teams. \n\nMost importantly, all of these transformations happened because of his personal approach to each team member, his expertise, and his ability to inspire people. Watching the design team evolve, I was very inspired by Kirill's work.",

Есть хорошие приложения, которые люди используют каждый день, и сотни тысяч плохих приложений, которые попадают на устройство по ошибке и удаляются.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nДля простого человека (меня) эта разница почти неуловима. Они используют один и тот же язык программирования, одни библиотеки, одни и те же руководства по оформлению. Но у одних людей получается - и приложение является продолжением продукта под кончиками пальцев, а у других нет, и люди или пользуются ими вынужденно или удаляют.\r\n\r\nТак же и мобильные разработчики - они или делают приложения первого типа или второго. Я не видел еще какой-то середины тут. На её месте просто пропасть.\r\n\r\nАндрей Давыдов относится к первому типу. У него есть какой-то загадочный внутренний компас, как у Джека Воробья, который позволяет ему отличать зерна от плевел. Может быть это оттого, что на его старом айфоне установлены сотни приложений, экраны которых отсортированы по оттенкам пиктограмм, может быть от того, что он знает какая функция кем была впервые применена, какая \"выстрелила\", а какая - нет, и почему. Может быть просто следит за новостями, может быть у него есть просто друзья, которые дают ему информацию. Не знаю.\r\n\r\nНо, работая с Андреем - чувствуешь, что строишь приложение первого типа. Такое как \"Рокетбанк\", как Hotel Tonight, как Aviasales, AirBnB, Swarm, Shazam, Flipboard. С уютным чатом и фотографиями из края в край, с функциональной анимацией, которая заставляет возвращаться снова и снова, с элементами сбалансированной геймификации.\r\n\r\nОбычного ответственного, организованного и исполнительного  мобильного продукт-менеджера сейчас найти довольно просто, а человека который обладает внутренним компасом, чтобы сделать приложение, которое не стыдно оставить на своем телефоне, приложение в который сотни тысяч пользователей (и самых лучших твоих пользователей, самых лояльных) будут возвращаться каждый день - такого Джека Воробья найти сложно. А когда нашел - стоит держаться.",

Вместе с коллегами создавал команды, реализовывал для компаний сложные стратегические проекты, запускал новые сервисы.\n\nВ контексте работы с командами ориентируюсь на такие важные принципы, как меритократия идей, фокус на здоровье сервисов и удовлетворенность наших пользователей, внешних и внутренних. Для оценки качества процессов разработки отдаю предпочтение DORA-метрикам.\n\nВ контексте работы с проектами предпочитаю современные гибкие методологии и подходы, ориентированные на эксперименты и получение быстрой обратной связи от пользователей. \n\nВ работе с людьми верю в важность подбора правильных кандидатов, которые подходят по опыту и навыкам под заявленные цели, способны действовать смело и самостоятельно, умеют находить таких же хороших сотрудников. Не ругаю за ошибки, но делаю всё, чтобы извлечь их них правильный опыт и не повторять. Вырастил несколько крутых тимлидов из не менее классных разработчиков.",

My responsibilities include overseeing the development of technologies for preventing financial fraud, models for detecting deepfakes, and improving document intelligence.\n\nI live in Berlin with my wife and two borzoi dogs, and I frequently visit Tel-Aviv.\n\nPrior to my current position, I worked at Tinkoff, a leading fintech company, as a Director of AI. At Tinkoff, I was responsible for owning and driving Tinkoff's AI strategy, as well as establishing and managing the Tinkoff Center for AI technologies (which consisted of more than 300 people and 20+ teams). I quit and emigrated to Germany after the war started.\n\nBefore Tinkoff, I was the Head of Applied Research at VKontakte, the largest European social network. My team aimed at advancing ML algorithms as well as bringing the latest technologies to VK. I was also responsible for newsfeed ranking and led the development and deployment of VK speech recognition for voice messages (200M per day) and a set of technologies for reducing hate speech on the platform. During that time, we also released yttm (https://github.com/VKCOM/YouTokenToMe), the fastest text tokenizer.\n\nIn October 2019, I founded and led VK AI Research Lab @ Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, a small lab focused on NLP research. Our work included making language models less toxic.\n\nMy background is in software engineering. I graduated from Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical University with an MS summa cum laude in Computer Science and spent more than 6 years working at Motorola across the globe. Specifically, I was part of the team that developed au-Box and HD-STB set-top boxes.\n\nI speak English, Japanese, German and Russian.\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy running, cycling, and cross-country skiing.",

From scaling startups to leading teams in large organizations, I’ve navigated the full spectrum of product management, digital marketing, user acquisition, and monetization. Along the way, I co-founded two companies, with one leading to a successful exit.\n\nCurrently, I lead growth at Telegram Wallet, working to bring crypto to millions of users. Before that, I was General Manager at Key App, a blockchain-based money transfer startup.\n\nPrior to Key App, I served as Chief Product Officer and Chief Monetization Officer at VK, where I scaled a fast-growing team, developed the product strategy, and helped drive 9-digit annual revenue (USD).\n\nEarlier in my career, I was one of the first employees at ivi.ru, where I helped grow it into ex-USSR VOD market leader, serving 50 million monthly active users.\n\nI hold a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics.",

Her empathy and exceptional soft skills helped us navigate even the most complicated situations, like employee transfers, relocations, and international issues. She was always there for us, ready to provide support.\n\nWhat really stood out about Elena was her ability to connect with people. Sure, it's a basic skill for an HR person, but Elena makes it look effortless. She genuinely cares about the people she works with and takes the time to build trustworthy and transparent relationships with them.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Elena for any HR or recruiting position. She's a true professional who brings empathy, hard work, and exceptional communication skills to the table. Any team would be lucky to have her.",

          "description": "Igor and I worked together in his capacity as a Deep Learning Engineer, and I must say he consistently proved to be an invaluable individual contributor for two key reasons:\n\nFirstly, his strong background in mathematics and computer science enabled him to excel in research and development tasks. He consistently delivered novel machine learning approaches that aligned perfectly with our objectives and were highly computationally efficient. This was crucial in keeping our GPU power costs in check.\n\nFurthermore, Igor possessed the essential skill of bridging the gap between technical research and real-world business needs. Not all research endeavors directly contribute to finding a product-market fit, but Igor always went the extra mile to assist the team by implementing ad-hoc solutions. This proactive approach allowed us to iterate quickly and facilitate product research effectively.\n\nIn summary, I can confidently state that Igor is an exceptional engineer and individual contributor. I wholeheartedly recommend him for product-related research and development roles, especially when algorithms play a pivotal role in bringing products to market.",

          "description": "I've been managing Ilnur for all of his time at Meta and Instagram, firstly in eCommerce and later in the Explore surface. Ilnur is one of the strongest raw machine learning talents I have worked with and is able to learn and grow at a phenomenal rate. Ilnur is able to cover the whole lifecycle end-to-end, from strategy, academic research, ideation, planning, collaboration, execution and experimentation. And he's strong at all of these. The retrieval strategy he wrote for Explore was a real highlight in it's clarity and has been the direction for the team for the last year. \n\nIlnur also has a second career writing summaries of English language IR/ML papers into his native language, has a great coverage of the best papers, and is able to explain many papers succinctly, which is a great benefit to the team. \n\nFor someone so young in his career to successfully independently lead a major ML workstream - retrieval - of a surface handling over 500 million users/month is an indication of how strong Ilnur is. He would make an amazing asset to any ML team.",

Ilnur was the main engineer responsible for content recommendations retrieval and he was the key person rebuilding legacy retrieval stack to use state of the art technologies like TTSN, achieving strong wins in recommendations quality and overall product engagement.\n\nIlnur has very strong ML fundamentals, he can independently run analysis to understand gaps and opportunities, setup metrics and goals and come up with a good set of ideas and experiments to improve the system. Ilnur is very productive and very structured in his approach, his plans and progress are always clear and well communicated to the team. In addition to that, Ilnur is very eager to help his teammates, share knowledge, provide great feedback during code reviews (he does a lot of those!) and have insightful conversations. Overall it has been a great pleasure working with Ilnur!",

I specialize in designing for complex, data-driven interfaces, mobile apps, e-commerce platforms, and browser applications. I love rolling up my sleeves and working alongside teams to turn ideas into user experiences that not only look great but also deliver real results.\n\nOver the years, I’ve had the chance to lead the redesign of some amazing projects at Mail.ru Group and Rambler, achieving real impact along the way:\n\n📌 Media projects: Unified the design across multiple platforms, improving consistency and making users happier.\n📌 Recommendation system Pulse: Modernized a personalized content feed that’s now seamlessly integrated with the company’s recommendation engine—boosting engagement in the process.\n📌 Charity projects Dobro: Simplified donation flows and strengthened the brand, earning more user trust and increasing recurring donations.\n📌 Rambler Search: Reimagined the search interface for millions of daily users, enhancing clarity and ease of use.\n\nIn all these projects, I worked in design systems that helped teams make it easier to deliver great designs without slowing anyone down.\n\nMy portfolio shows my knack for solving complex design problems, applying UX principles, and working closely with engineers, product managers, and stakeholders. I’m all about finding the sweet spot between user needs and business goals—and making it work beautifully.\n\nTools and skills I use:\n• Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, Blender, and AI tools\n• UX/UI design and prototyping\n• Team leadership and collaboration\n• Scalable design systems\n• Design thinking and problem-solving\n• Working in agile environments\n\nA bit more about me\nWhen I’m not designing, I’m probably exploring new design trends, sharpening my skills at workshops, or following what’s happening in the UX/UI world. I’m also learning English at San Francisco City College, which is a fun challenge! Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, volunteering, and spending time with my dog Azul.\n\nLet’s collaborate to create impactful design solutions that make a difference!",

He was always on time or early, and ready to work.  The quality of Nikolai's work was excellent: he took initiative in preparing and refocusing students.  Without supervisoral guidance, he could perceive and address challenges experienced by both students and myself.  in the classroom there's not much time to discuss problems and solutions!  Nikolai would take the initiative and act.  My classroom functioned much better when Nikolai was present.\nI also want to mention that in my multi-cultural, multi-lingual classroom, the students perceived that Nikolai respected them and met them where they were academically.  They grew to trust him and solicited his help, as did I.  I know that Nikolai will give his best to any new situation, and that his new supervisor and colleagues will be fortunate to work with him.",

He is communicating technical solutions/issues very well to a lay person, which is really helpful to move things forward if you're not an IT specialist. \nHe does not shy away from problems, but finds them interesting sometimes to the level of welcoming them, because they expand his knowledge and experience. He delivers great quality work and one can always count on him, as he is a very reliable and dedicated person.\nI enjoyed working with Rauf a lot, he is one of a kind.",

I firmly believe that Rauf is like a living encyclopaedia of SAP hybris: whatever you ask from him, he can immediately answer it or ready to make a quick proof of concept that gives you all input you need. When I wrote 'quick', I meant: REALLY quick, as Rauf is very hands-on and not only in SAP Hybris. He puts an enormous amount of effort in whatever he's working on, so one can be assured that the technical solution Rauf designs is always based on solid foundations. It's also worth highlighting that his blog is a well respected source of insights about SAP Hybris and e-commerce world-wide ... with lots of readers including SAP themselves. It was a pleasure to work with Rauf and I can sincerely recommend him to anyone wishing to achieve: RESULTS.",

On a personal note, I don't get a chance that often to meet people who are as down-to-earth and humble as Rauf.  He is extremely friendly, open and honest as a character, and for these reasons too I can only recommend the man highly.  All the very best to you, Rauf.",
