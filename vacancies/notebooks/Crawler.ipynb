      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Key changes and explanations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **`_load_all_content` improvements:**\n",
      "   - Added `await page.wait_for_load_state(\"networkidle\")` at the beginning to ensure the initial page content is fully loaded before attempting to extract links or find the \"Show more\" button. This helps prevent issues if the page takes a moment to load all its elements.\n",
      "   - Changed the selector for links to `.VacancyCard__button-desktop_kq6NiZ a` to specifically target the `<a>` elements *within* the \"Откликнуться\" buttons. This is more precise and avoids accidentally picking up other links on the page.\n",
      "   - Changed the selector for the \"Show more\" button to `button[data-qa-type=\"vc:show-more-btn\"]`. This uses a data attribute, which is generally more reliable than relying on class names or CSS structure that might change.\n",
      "   - Added `await page.wait_for_timeout(2000)` after clicking \"Show more\". This short delay can be helpful to allow the new content to fully render before the next iteration of the loop.  You might need to adjust this timeout depending on the website's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **`_extract_links` simplified:**\n",
      "   -  The `getattr` is unnecessary.  Since `self.all_links` is initialized in the constructor, you can directly return `list(self.all_links)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Base URL:**\n",
      "   - Updated the base URL in the `__init__` method to the correct Tinkoff vacancies URL.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Error Handling:**\n",
      "   - The `try...except` block in `_load_all_content` is important for robustness. It catches potential errors during pagination (e.g., if the button is not found or if the page fails to load) and prevents the script from crashing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This improved class should be more reliable and efficient at extracting vacancy links from the Tinkoff website.  Remember to test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.  If the website structure changes, you may need to update the selectors accordingly.\n"
